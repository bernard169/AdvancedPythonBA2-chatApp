Author : Bernard Tourneur and Jonathan Miel
===============================================
GENERAL USAGE NOTES :
- This chat app is used to communicate between 
    terminals.
- To begin a chatroom, users must "join" other 
    clients using their IPV4 adress and port 
    number.
- server.py file is used to get other users' IPV4
    address. A server must first be started with 
    the command "python server.py server", then 
    the clients can connect themselves to it with 
    "python server.py client", to get a list of 
    every other client and their adress.
- Commands in the chat App are quiet explicit, 
    they must all be preceded by a "/".
